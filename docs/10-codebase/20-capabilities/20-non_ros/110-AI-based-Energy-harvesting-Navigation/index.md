This repository contains the Energy Harvesting Aware Path Planning Python codes. It uses PPO and Q-learning methods to find the best path inside the environment considering the tradeoff between distance and energy harvesting opportunities. 
This research uses the Open-AI Gymnasium tool to simulate the environment and the learning process of PPO. Also, to adapt the Q-learning to the problem, the traditional Q-learning method is used. 
The codes simulate different scenarios to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. This analysis investigates the impact of grid size, light source, harvesting range, multiple robots, and reward weight on navigation performance. The comprehensive results comparison is accessible in deliverable T3.4.



Installation Guide

**Step 1**: Install Required Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

pip install gymnasium 

pip install numpy

pip install pygame


**Step 2**: Verify Installation

To confirm that everything is installed correctly, open Python and try importing the modules:

import gymnasium as gym

from gymnasium import spaces

import numpy as np

import pygame

If no errors appear, the installation was successful.

**Step 3**: Running the Code

Now, execute the following codes to see the results:
